<p>My name is <b> Jose Benjamin Molina </b> </p>
<p> I was born in Bogota, Colombia but I arrived to the United States, Miami at 4 years of age. Now I currently live in Tamarac, Floridaw. Both of my parents were born and raised in Colombia. At the time of me writing this I'm 14 years of age. </p>
<p> I have one sibling, which is a little sister. I love her a lot. I like to be an example for her, not just somebody to look up to and look for but also someone she could talk to. I belive a social dynamic like that is key to having a proper relationship; relationship in any sense </p>
