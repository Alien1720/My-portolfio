<h3>I am interested in many things</h3>

<p>I like to learn, maybe the learning process some schools offer not so much but learning and being able to understand and know what was previously unkown is really interesting.  </p>
<p>Something that really interest me is science; science as a whole. Chemistry, mycology, psychology are some but not all fields I find interesting. The field that interest me the most is philosophy, the study of thought is (depending on the field:of both philosophy and other things) the basis for everything. </p>

<p> A book I really enjoyed reading was <b>Apology</b> by Plato</p>
